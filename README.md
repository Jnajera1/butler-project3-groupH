Final Project: Understanding the Possible Relationship of Non-Standard Market Pressures on Stocks

Topic: This project would look to examine if any interplay exists between the WallStreetBets subreddit and stock prices from 2012 to now. This would be accomplished by analyzing the text and titles of posts for the most common names of companies and stocks, the timeframe they were trending, and comparing that to stock price data for the same time periods. Using the Gamestop event as a baseline, this analysis could be expanded to judge if this particular non-standard market pressure has had any other appreciable effect on the market in the past.

Why: The WSB-Gamestop saga seems incredibly and I’m curious if this particular group has had any noticeable effect on the market in the past or if they achieved their most recent effects after reaching some sort of critical mass.

Ideas: I’d imagine Machine Learning could perhaps be used to analyze the text of the posts and determine whether they were positive on their subject, in this case a particular stock or company, then that data could be compared to a stock’s performance. This would require bringing in more data for analysis once the stock once the most conversed about relevant terms were discovered.
